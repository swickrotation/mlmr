### "Doing for Marx and Engels what data has done for Shakespeare!"

We seek to create a document that contains the entire works of Marx and Engels, as well as a database of the n-grams contained therein. Answering the kinds of questions like when did "dictatorship of the proletariat" occur first, and how often afterwards, and the correlation between phrses like that and "dialectical materialism" in time.

This will require several tools, from OCR methods, reinforcement learning, data-visualization, and sheer database administration. Leveraging our narrow corner of expertise as people who need to ask "which ML are you talking about?", we introduce The **M**achine **L**earning **M**arx **R**eader (MLMR).
