### "How is this not in the Public Domain?"

A great deal of the writings of Marx and Engels have been aggregated by publishers, and while much of the writings themselves are within the public domain, the commentary or translations of those writings may not be. We seek to create a document that contains just the works of Marx and Engels, as well as a database of the n-grams of the writers. Answering the kinds of questions like when did "dictatorship of the proletariat" occur first, and how often afterwards. 

This will require several tools, from OCR methods, reinforcement learning, data-visualization, and sheer database administration. Leveraging our narrow corner of expertise as people who need to ask "which ML are you talking about?", we introduce The **M**achine **L**earning **M**arx **R**eader (MLMR).
