### "How is this not in the Public Domain?"

A great deal of the writing of Marx have been aggregated by publishers, and while the writings themselves are within the public domain, the commentary or translations of those writings may not be. As a purely academic exercise, we seek to create a document that strictly contains the writings. 

To do this we feed a purchased, proprietary copy of the desired text to our program, and it spits out the text sans-footnote. Leveraging our narrow corner of expertise as people who need to ask "which ML are you talking about?", we introduce The **M**achine **L**earning **M**arx **R**ecompiler (MLMR). We welcome all comrades in computing to our community project.
